  @moduledoc """
   The server query group of commands has been designed to return
   information about any server which is connected to the network.  All
   servers connected must respond to these queries and respond
   correctly.  Any invalid response (or lack thereof) must be considered
   a sign of a broken server and it must be disconnected/disabled as
   soon as possible until the situation is remedied.

   In these queries, where a parameter appears as "<server>", it will
   usually mean it can be a nickname or a server or a wildcard name of
   some sort.  For each parameter, however, only one query and set of
   replies is to be generated.
